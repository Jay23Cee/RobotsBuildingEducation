# Welcome To RO.B.E
As is tradition, we're going to start with a draft and move quickly. 
You're encouraged to read first and ask questions later. Zoom out and think outside of the box when reading this.
Here are some philosophies I follow:

1. Education is sensitive. If not disruptive, technology is interruptive. Better to wait for the right technology.
2. View software as a digital twin of the real-world.
3. How customers use an app informs its direction.
4. If you change the incentive, you change the behavior.
5. People empowered by machines rather than machines empowered by people.
6. Build to have people focus on more important things like their family, community or goals.
7. Overrepresent ideals unaligned with reality. 


There are several products under development here. You are encouraged to build your own version of it or contribute as you see fit.

## Project Appletree
This is a product centered around the needs of educators. It is not limited to public school educators but that is the spirit of the product. Right now, it's OpenAI creating courses in the current UI. It allows people to rapidly create content and store data to their profile. Long-term, we need to allow people to customize and add human-touch or curation to their material.


## Project Indocumentadofy
A platform to educate and onboard undocumented immigrants into the rapidly growing Shopify ecosystem and consulting opportunities. From a stock market perspective, Shopify is investing heavily into the creator economy by developing product for organizations like Meta or Pinterest. There's a lot of context to this choice but I feel like it's an awfully reasonable way to introduce people into different and potentially lucrative economies or skills across the globe.

Financial technology and programmable money is here to stay and whether it comes from Shopify or Cash App or Coinbase, it's going to have to figure out a way to interoperate with existing systems and networks. So I think it's a good well-rounded bet to go from coding to business skills. To be frank, you can have an undocumented teenager choose a farm, a factory, a kitchen or a remote office. There are no rules preventing an undocumented person from charging $2000 for a service he or she can get comfortably done in a weekend. Let's pour resources into the remote office.


## Project Impact 
Impact is the currency system used in Robots Building Education. Based on the task perform, impact is generated. Given that RO.B.E is a system designed around automation and user experiences, impact effectively represents the work performed by the robots. As it currently stands, 90% of subscriptions is re-invested back into the community while 10% is held in a reserve of Bitcoin.

This idea can be actualized further in various ways with more software engineering and careful education policy. Project Impact is mostly why I work on Robots Building Education and I consider it the heart of all of the work that I do. 

## Project TapDM

TapDM is a social network of chats. I think there's a ton of education happening in DMs. I want people to have their 1-on-1 or small-group-chats public for following but personal for people participating.


## Conclusion

Take some time to think about all of it. There is plenty to work on. The next update will talk more on how the current software is developed.
