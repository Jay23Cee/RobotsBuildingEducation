# 1. Welcome To RO.B.E

Robots Building Education is a research project centered
around building universal basic income technology.

In 2023, it takes the form of a mentor generating scholarships through "work" with a primarily Latino community.

Please considering supporting my work here, where I offer personal services.

# 2. Code Quality

If you have joined the Patreon, you know the "Publish, Refine, Release" strategy we use here. Eventually, we want refinements to take us to a level where the code is so readable and intuitive that people on social media can casually understand it with no experience.

So this means improving the quality of comments, variable names and data flow over time. The point isn't to write epicly awesome software - the point is to be teachable and inspiring for newcomes. The code should be good enough that it explains itself in a simple screenshot or carousel of screenshots
