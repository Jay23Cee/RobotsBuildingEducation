## The First Generation Investor: Financial Technology & Cryptocurrency

A thought:

The future of education will more closely express what learning is: an expression of effort, time, and energy. The future of education will not fit in previous models defined by arbitrary institutions that brokerage trust through "education" certifications.

3. Financial Technology Investing
   Consider the following relationship:

An eighteen year old Black American can date their family back hundreds of years to some enslaved origin point. This same American is a pioneer in the family name as they invest in the US stock market for the first time in 2020. After several world revolutions, political movements and scientific advancements, an internet application had finally amended the fair access to the financial service.

Financial technology is ultimately defined by and understood with critical race theory. Critical race theory is the philosophy behind the intersection of race, history, and power. The entire financial system is a system that attempts to govern and monitor the risk of each transaction by proving that the individual behind the transaction is not committing some kind of crime. This statement alone is worth multiple conversations which need to come together into one cohesive idea.

So we need to illustrate the conversations behind race, history, power and the access to resources in order to understand the direction of the current financial technology industry. Decentralization, at its core, is the redistribution of power granted by some central entity or entities, so it only makes sense to observe critical race theory and its intersection with transforming technology.

I find it fascinating that many Black Americans today are essentially immigrants to their own country where the first fair rights were afforded only just a few decades ago. In my view, critical race theory allows someone to consider the special conditions of groups with native and genocided origins. In the North American case, we would observe the power struggles experienced by Black Americans, the indigenous, and Hispanics. In Asia, we would observe groups in North Korea.

In Eurasia, we can observe groups like the Israelis. The simple truth here is that genocides have far reaching consequences across many generations. Understanding and respecting the value of critical race theory allows you to observe truly phenomenal relationships. Let us set up one modern struggle: the US drug war, the demographics of incarcerated Americans, and the violence experienced south of the US border. Then let us observe the nature of trust as the ultimate form of value in the financial system.

A simple and safe transaction in any given scenario between a merchant and customer would be a cash transaction. I agree to purchase a good or service with a US note backed by some credit reserve and the money instantly settles due to it being in the form of cash. This entire system completely fails if I offer you a convincing counterfeit bill.

So then this issue of trust can be observed regionally, where cash transactions may vary in risk at a highway gas station versus some mall in a city suburb. The point here is that, despite the simple circumstances, much can still fundamentally go wrong.

The entire process then transforms in complexity at the digital stage. There are entire systems and economies that are built to monitor and verify this trust between merchant and customer that then produces the infamous service and brokerage fee. This cash does not instantly settle, so the spender must spend in order to use their own money as a way to counteract the risk associated with making transactions digitally.

What is challenging about the digital system is that it depends on legal frameworks that are based on power and liberty. They are compliant standards that require an individual to prove that they are not a blacklisted immigrant, criminal, or terrorist through the form of various sensitive documentations like a social security number or personal address.

What this means is that just about every digital financial system functions off of a “verify first, trust later” model that effectively has you prove that you are not a criminal in order to use their discriminate systems. It is at this point where you might see that cryptocurrency advocates are encouraged to look for new systems that destructure and challenge the power struggles created by these legal frameworks.

I hope that by this point, the reader can begin to see the relationships I’m trying to illustrate between historical powers, race, and financial institutions. In short, the US has staged some militant status quo involving drugs, terrorism, and the financing of systemic war, while also maintaining a financial system that monitors crime and terrorism. This relationship expresses itself in rather perverse ways. For example, is the security at an airport meant for airplane safety or is it just an incredibly cheap way to monitor immigration status?

These legal frameworks have generational consequences on job availability, school funding, and access to many basic resources like safety and banking that govern our day to day life. How could one expect for a bank to survive in areas that are overpoliced, where jobs are erased, and where deposits decrease in supply?

So returning back to the conversation about race and power, one can observe fascinating relationships and problems worth solving. The financial technology industry is often driven by this narrative of amending services for the underbanked. When you observe the underbanked in North America, you see the same pattern - Black Americans in the southern US states, underdeveloped city “sides”, and nations south of the border. This is by design. Systems of modern finance are built off of those systems of trust that we outlined above.

What this design says is that these groups and regions are the least trusted groups, which is also true from a power perspective. One could see how this tragically results in a rather dangerous feedback loop and one could argue how this is one of the many forms of structural racism generated and maintained by the US technology industry.

The end result is an imbalance of power in the US, resulting in a lose-lose for its society. The failures of the drug war, its resulting incarcerations, and widespread overconsumption of drugs and policing is a product of this imbalanced power. My view is that race is only a circumstance of the nature of power and history, and in the case of the US, it’s worth deeply observing as it is uniquely positioned as a society in world history.

So with this entire context in mind, it becomes a lot easier to understand the significance of Bitcoin development and it's growing social currency in regions that have issues regarding transactions, trust, and violence like Latin America or Africa. Bitcoin believes in the inverse of the current system, a "trust first, verify later" model.

It also allows you to understand the entire ecosystem that drives organizations like Square and Robinhood. Whether it be services for small businesses, artists, or investors, the narrative remains the same: democratize financial services. Democratization logically follows conversations of liberty and power! Using this mental model, one can more critically observe the relationships that drove Jay-Z to join the board of Square, or Square's development of credit services that don't depend on credit checking.

The end result is that Square and other financial services are seeking ways to minimize risk and trust associated with digital transactions to reduce the overall cost of business and to enhance the delivery and accessibility of services. This is why I'm confident in financial technology's ability to transform and and improve our previous system.

And this framework is what allows me to understand and predict Square's roadmap in industries that it is not involved in yet, like education funding and home owner loan issuances.

Disclaimer
These are essays that I wrote when I first started my career as a content creator. I started as a writer on Reddit in May 2020-2021. I had recently started investing in the stock market after many years of market-watching on the sidelines while I went to school and learn computer science.

I think a lot of these early actions are important even if they're outdated. There should be some consistent truth to what I'm saying. The difference should be depth. My introduction to the stock market was through products like Bitcoin, AMD, Paypal, Shopify, Tesla, Facebook and the like from 2016 onward. Not much has changed.

I think it's a great position to be in as a tech investor. I have the benefits of growing up with technology and in some ways I can kind of see that the internet was a child when I was a child and an adult when I was an adult.

It's great to have be on the horizon of seeing these companies perform in the market for that famous "10 year" amount and it's great being a customer of many of these organizations for up to 20 years.

Eventually, these essays will be improved upon - things change. You may see some of the changes already in other Patreon posts. They serve as domains of business or product knowledge. It should help you think about technology more too. Some essays are better than others.

I was writing for an audience that I largely did not care about and was constrained by that relationship. So some sections are more thoughtful than others to serve the relevancy matrix of the forum I was participating in.

After the recent failures of FTX along with the tech recession, I figured it would be good to review the fundamentals, since it seems that most people move on from the fundamentals too quickly during speculative markets.

To keep it brief, I started learning about Bitcoin and cryptocurrency sometime around 2015 when I was studying operating systems in school. It just made sense to me as a digital native. Today, I work as an engineer at a financial technology company that’s focused on embedded finance and open-banking.

I’m going to keep things pretty simple and in plain language so that more people can understand, but at the end of the day it’s really not that complicated. The hard part is trying to understand what information is actually worthwhile, productive, truthful and creative.

If you want to skip ahead and do your own research, I recommend to follow and study these organizations in order:

- Bank Secrecy Act
- The US Drug War
- Bitcoin
- AMD Xilinx
- Block (Cash App’s parent company)
- Bluesky
- IPFS
- USDC
- Dogecoin
- Cloudflare

Anyway the Proof of Work system that governs Bitcoin is pretty easy to illustrate. Machines use energy to perform work. Bitcoin takes it one step further and assigns an economic value to that relationship.

So why does that matter? Well the reality is that technology is going to continue to advance, grow and automate things we once did. Productivity will go up and the nature of work will change. This has already happened.

We aren’t used to assigning salary to the work performed by an AI algorithm or the work done by a robot but we eventually will.
So Bitcoin creates a relationship out of what happens when machines physically do work and the salary created out of it.

To review, machines are using tiny pieces of chemicals and metals to create all the stuff that we see on the internet. So our shared digital space, when you really think about it, is still very physical. It burns energy and consumes oil no different than a car engine or a factory plant.

In a nutshell, as machines and networks improve, so will Bitcoin. Many people appreciate that simplicity.
Proof of Stake, on the other hand, depends on people’s contribution and participation in the system. It depends on adoption. I’m not going to say that Proof of Stake is inherently bad or wrong, but it comes with risks that people seem to ignore.

Proof of Stake depends on being able to trust others when participating in the system. It can lead to successful inventions or foolish failures. We can appreciate this truth when looking at fiat systems, governed by reserves, ordered by governments and informed by other structural conditions of society that have us participate in various economic and market systems.

In my view, Bitcoin and its influence over the market is far more compelling from an innovative and social perspective. It has a wonderful forward path in the ability to create a future economy that’s informed by automation, productivity and intelligent computing. From a political perspective, this seems to be related to our inevitable considerations of universal basic income.

From a cultural perspective, Bitcoin seems to endorse security, privacy and a more fair internet. A more fair space. This has resulted in the development of projects that allow users to navigate between social services. For example, if I were to get banned from TikTok, I would not lose my following and could use a service on Twitter instead to reach my audience.

If I wanted to buy a service or item, I don’t have to go through several layers of applications to create that exchange. I would be able to receive Venmo transactions from my Cash App. It’s digital cash. It's a way where I can represent my identity in the digital space without state-sanctioned verifiers and credentialers.

Bitcoin doesn’t seek to convince others to join it. It convinces engineers to rethink and expand services that already exist.
So here’s the issue with crypto, media, influence and the market.

It’s often a victim of stakeholder capitalism. I think Charlie Munger illustrated it best:
“Big-shot businessmen get into these waves of social proof. Do you remember some years ago when one oil company bought a fertilizer company, and every other major oil company practically ran out and bought a fertilizer company? And there was no damned reason for all these oil companies to buy fertilizer companies, but they didn’t know exactly what to do, and if Exxon was doing it, it was good enough for Mobil, and vice versa. I think they’re all gone now, but it was a total disaster.”

So that’s the same reason why, despite being an expert, most people would dismiss my idea that Dogecoin has more economic value than 99.9% of cryptocurrencies. It’s the reason why something like an NFT can be suddenly compelling and earth-shaking rather than just a modest feature for already existing services. Dogecoin is a simple proof-of-work system that was born out of an idea that tried to improve Bitcoin.

Its reputation is loved and respected. Its social recognition is far greater than even that of Ethereum. If you were to ask a young individual today which coin they liked the most, without considering the possibility of profit or “winning the crypto game”, I would wager most people would elect Dogecoin.
But unfortunately, stakeholder capitalism is a game of bias, trust and relationships.

We will be focusing on that economic reality in this writing often, and you’ll often see me disregard financial statements or other regurgitated content in financial media. This is about understanding what drives real innovation and impact in the market.

So why are engineers and innovators so interested in Bitcoin or these blockchains in the first place? How does it relate to Jay Z? One ought to consider the context of Black American history and the consequence of systemic oppression that muddies much of American history.

Much deeper conversations can be read in books like “The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration In The Age Of Colorblindness” and “Race After Technology: Abolitionist Tools For The New Jim Code”. However in our case, we can observe the history of the policies that govern the financial technology industry.
The financial technology industry is largely an extension of the banking sector.

It must follow so-called regulations revolving around anti-money laundering and financial crimes. I’m not here to write about the political currency of this implementation, but its origin is in 1970, only a few years after the completion of the Civil Rights Acts and one year prior to the launch of the Drug War.

What I’m trying to say here is that it’s not much of a coincidence why Bitcoin or cryptocurrency became an element of international drug trade in places like the Silk Road or Dark Web.
It’s also not a coincidence why folks like Charlie Munger are not fond of the system. According to investors like Charlie Munger, these new currencies are bad because they cannot detect crime.

But what this also means is that you belong to a system that assumes you are untrustworthy first that must essentially verify that you aren't an undocumented immigrant, a drug trading criminal, or a terrorist. These relationships are constantly monitored in things like credit score, access to loans, and other means of securing wealth which is exactly where banks fall into institutional oppression.

They're systems we are either unaware of or numb to - but they are wrong. They are unfair and unjust. Frankly, Charlie Munger could never be someone like Jay Z either.
And this history matters so much. It explains why gangster rap was created. It explains today’s connection of hip-hop to our history of colonization and slavery. It defines our attitudes, culture and perception of our space.

One might think it’s a stretch, but you couldn’t log onto a platform like Tiktok today and livestream with cannabis present. Machine learning algorithms would detect it and temporarily suspend you from streaming. It also informs the economic reality that recently trusted cannabis shops will be built with Square websites, using Square payment systems, with customers using their Cash Apps and Cash Cards so that they can exchange cannabis legally in the financial technology network.

One could appreciate how Cash App allows for an alternative payment system where users don’t agree to inform machine learning algorithms about their transactions. There is no all-seeing eye to examine what I transacted. When examining the industry critically, you can see how these artificially intelligent machines become statistically more strict with names impacted by these anti money laundering acts.

The Fundamental Constraint
MOD DISCLAIMER: This post discusses B\*tcoin in an academic sense. I absolutely do not intend for this post to be speculative about the asset by any means and it is solely within the context of Square's strategy, business risk, and environment. This post is about under-banking, regulatory constraints, and financial services.

The Underbanking Map
This one is not going to be easy to understand, so get your coffee ready and get comfortable. It’s going to be difficult to digest the technology behind Square because it asks you to believe the premise that banking is going to change in unforeseeable ways in the near future. I currently work in the Banking-as-a-Service sector as an engineer, so I have some insight that I could offer.

A fair amount of people may not know this, but organizations like Stripe, Square, PayPal, and other fintech infrastructures are just network layers over existing banks. For example, Stripe partners with Evolve Bank while Square partners with Sutton Bank. This is a win-win scenario, for now, where banks get to see the benefits of technology distribution powers, while tech companies gain a shortcut to regulatory requirements.

It may help to accept this by understanding the idea that drives the financial technology sector. In order to distribute financial services to people, regardless of net worth, trustworthiness and accountability must be established.

These are regulatory frameworks developed by the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), Anti Money Laundering (AML) or Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) that are also challenged by such technologies like B\*tcoin, where validation is arbitrary and based on advanced fingerprinted privacy.

This trustworthiness is also the reason why you’re able to instantly invest in your RH account - you are a trusted user and there is no reason to believe that you are somebody else.

The KYC Bottleneck
Just take Charlie Munger's advice to inverse. If these new currencies are bad because they cannot detect crime, then it means that you belong to a system that assumes you are untrustworthy first. These relationships are constantly monitored in things like credit score, loans, and other means of securing wealth.

The KYC Solution
It is, then, no secret as to why Square invested in B\*tcoin. There are other reasons, even cultural, as to why they did, but the basic root behind the decision is that it allows research into new verification methods that makes shipping financial services even more frictionless.

It is a potential vector for changing the rules of the game and leveling the playing field, so to speak. Being a software-first bank allows you to distribute at a much more rapid pace than a traditional large bank. To be totally frank, the American banking industry has quite a brutal history. Enter Jay-Z.

In short, The fuel of fintech is the underbanked. The combustion engine that burns it is cybersecurity and AI to validate that a user is trustworthy each time they commit a transaction. This is known as the KYC Problem and how each organization approaches the regulatory requirement to verify that a user is not committing fraud will determine the outcome of who dominates the fintech sector. This is also why you see customer-service as a pervasive problem.

The Underbanked
Jack Dorsey is an interesting character, who views on technology can be highlighted

The playbook
Interestingly enough, Twitter is used in such a manner. The Tweet system these days gets shared across all social media platforms due to its simple design and even appears interactively during sporting events or billboards.

In my view, Jack Dorsey sees the current period of time as a turning point in internet communications and the underbanked. It is clear as day in its marketing strategy, where Square seller services is marketed strongly toward immigrants and minority America while Cash App is strongly marketed toward young, first-time banking customers.
No really, go ahead and look at two things:

- Cash App’s Twitter and advertising strategy

Urban strategy
Youth strategy

- The geographic results on Google Trends when searching “Cash App vs. Venmo”. Southern USA generally sees less banking due to increased poverty.

Underbanking strategy
It is clear as day and the reason is due to the nature of the demographics of underbanked users. You see, access to banking is not much different than access to the internet or access to clean water. That is, the closer you are to poverty, the closer you are to lacking access to basic resources.

What is interesting about Square’s youth and culture strategy is that it builds a life-long trust with the org. You’ve heard it before, “why doesn’t school teach us important thing like taxes or investing?”. Square is attacking that pulse in its design. It offers:

The ability to start a business
The ability to invest and educate in basic stocks
The ability to invest and educate in B\*tcoin
The ability to save on basic purchases
The ability to file taxes (not yet, but the company acquired the means to)

Reality
What this inevitably means is that we probably won’t even see Square operating at “full-force” until at least 2030 and beyond, as these early aged customers grow with Square and embed more of their financials.

Speculation
This is what I expect after examining regulatory environments, product quality, and competitive outlooks:
Square will either acquire Sutton Bank or reduce its dependency on Sutton Bank’s regulatory offerings.

Square will become a bank to avoid direct competition with Big Tech, while competing aggressively against Big Banking by offering the ability to ship financial services.
The way they will achieve this is by developing a stronger form of cybersecurity and AI that will allow a smoother verification process.

Square will develop an internet railway, where exchanging currency will be accessible in different mediums like video-games or streams that may compete with organizations like Visa or MasterCard.

Square will compete with Banking-as-a-service and checkout offerings like Stripe, Plaid, and Shopify.
Square will foray into equal housing.
Square will improved loan systems.
Square will enter taboo markets like cannabis.
