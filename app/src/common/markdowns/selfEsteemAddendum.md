Typically I just post the animated video in the app. Iâ€™m creating this with the in-person introduction, since this work has a different purpose than coding education. I believe this is the true foundation of a lot of the work I want us to do in the future that reaches far beyond a classroom or small community and I want it to be more personal. There will be a lot of challenging moments in the future, but the concepts taught here remain omnipresent in anything that gets accomplished. Thank you for your time! It is sincerely appreciated. I hope this provides introspection that is difficult to find. It is made with a lot of love.
