# 2. Social Metaverse Investing

You know, before formally introducing this writing, I have to admit that there is a particular challenge when it comes to writing this book and that is modifying for correct predictions or fundamental market shifts. This statement existed in the financial technology chapter but makes more sense to move up here in the technology introduction where we discuss the evolution of social media.

That is because the subject of conversation for the next few years will be the metaverse or the third iteration of the internet. This subject of conversation was essentially referenced in this chapter but the information is far more clear now and requires this final edit or revision. So let's begin.

It likely makes sense to discuss and break down what a social network really is since it is something that has significantly changed human behavior. I like to invest in what I frame as intent-based social media and this is likely a function of my age and relationship with the internet.

An intent-based social media platform is a network where the user is likely to use the application as a tool before considering entertainment. In short, social media exists on a spectrum ranging from intention to entertainment. One could see how a platform like TikTok is geared toward entertainment, while a platform like Pinterest is designed for intention. In this spectrum, we find many others in the middle like YouTube, Twitter, or Reddit.

This spectrum is critical to understand because it governs what kind of algorithms are used to drive the platform. In the case of entertainment-based media, like Instagram or TikTok, the platform seeks to understand the user so that it can fetch content that will entertain them.

Entertainment is a highly subjective endeavor which forces the platforms to depend on algorithms to connect users and content. It is the open field form. On the other side, the intent-based platform serves a designed function and relationship with the content creator.

For example, we visit Pinterest to create useful ideas, allowing content-creators to focus on the context of the platform. Google indexes websites so that users can portal into a library of website owners and services. Reddit curates loyal communities to drive its information and space.

The critical element of this spectrum is the complex conversations that drive privacy and security on platforms. Social media is how we interface with the internet and it is what we refer to as the second iteration of the internet. To briefly shift the tone of this conversation, the entertainment platform suffer from misinformation and propaganda driven campaigns.

This is a natural consequence of relying on algorithms that depend on short and effective messaging and may ultimately affect intent-based platforms that orbit closer to entertainment, like Reddit or Youtube. They are called Influencers after all. The conversations surrounding privacy ultimately discuss these worst-case scenarios, so they're important to be mindful of historically and forward-looking.

With this issue highlighted, I would like to admit that one of my prediction about Facebook was correct. It will exist in social media forever, due to most applications using Facebook's software development ecosystems to create websites and applications on any device.

This is similar to how Oracle will essentially exist forever as part of the computing world due to its widespread demand for system maintenance and improvements. This is set in stone and Facebook's drive for the metaverse ultimately points to how the leadership behind Facebook understands that social media is a forum that ebbs and flows with the population over time.

So let's explore the thinking behind the leading social media platform and why it knows how to navigate and pivot its product over the years and how it lead to Roblox becoming Facebook's primary competitor for the next decade by examining Pinterest so that we can understand what social media truly is as a first generation investor.

A social media platform is a forum. A forum is a place, meeting, or medium where ideas and views on a particular issue can be exchanged. Each forum accomplishes this in its own unique way. Twitter is fundamentally used to search for what someone is saying, while Pinterest is used to search for ideas.

Pinterest is a particularly interesting case due to hundreds of millions of women adopting the platform and achieving what Google+ had failed to accomplish - a social media platform that harnesses the power of search. I believe this is also an interesting examination of how influential women are to the market. One can question if Apple or Google would be as successful as they are without the seismic changes that the American workforce has adapted.

This spectrum distinction continues be important when investing in internet forums like Facebook, Twitter, or Snapchat because an investor would not want to mistake the differences between companies like Home Depot or Walmart. Both organizations exist in the retailing space, but the nature of the business, its incentives, and its customers are worlds apart.

So is Pinterest a social media platform, search service, or both? With this in mind, we might begin to see why Facebook implementing a hashtag, Instagram implementation stories, or TikTok implementing streams may be irrelevant when understanding the full potential of a service like Snapchat or Twitter and the wisdoms the drive its growth in the market. Before ever investing in a company you need to discover and completely understand the incentives that drive the customers to return to the product.

Without that, you are ultimately gambling in the market and driving through a fog hoping that things will turn out well.

What drives a social networking site is a user’s incentive to search or discover information in that particular forum. As a result, examining social networking sites can be a lot like comparing shopping centers, such that a shopper is incentivized to go to a location for a particular reason that is best served by that institution.

Pinterest uses pins, Reddit uses subreddits, and Google uses links - all having unique advantages as a means to distribute information.

The forum may take on a different medium. Google is used to answer information, Facebook allows us to connect, while online gaming satisfies our needs for adventure. When you examine the nature of a forum and a user’s incentive to participate in that forum, you’ll come to understand why a applications like Twitter, Pinterest, or online games like Roblox are a force of nature.

These forums engage and fulfill our very real needs and demands as social beings. It will also help you understand why companies like Facebook would endeavor in metaverse products like virtual reality games and other forms of social media.

Pinterest is closer to the adoption of applications like YouTube or Reddit, where users aren't necessarily sharing their profiles with friends and use the applications to search for information that they find meaningful to them. This is what is known as “personal media” rather than typical “social media”.

This is a characteristic that I believe grants a media platform a longer product lifespan. It will also be quite relevant when it comes to conversations about how users interact with the metaverse. Clearly, there will be users that enjoy the extroverted elements of it, while introverted users may prefer the personal media aspects of it. What I try to imagine is that the Instagram "mall" may be a more social space than the Pinterest "mall" in the metaverse.

The network-effect that built Pinterest has mostly been driven by women across all social-economic statuses, resulting in profound economic consequences across global households. What this ultimately results in is word-of-mouth adoption, where families learn how to use Pinterest as a tool and search engine rather than an application to connect with friends or family.

As a result, Pinterest’s recommendation model is geared to advertise to women-influenced interests, which we will touch on shortly. This has long-term positive consequences for product advertisers regardless of culture - which is exactly why Pinterest is performing remarkably well with international user adoption. Most American customers have already been effectively registered, where nearly 100 million American women are monthly active users.

These customers are voluntarily searching for ads. Behaviorally, this means that Pinterest’s customers are in a high willingness to engage with things that result in action. In other words, a Pinterest user is logging in because they need to start, plan, and consume something in the near future.

Customers do not need to be influenced into a product when the customer is coming onto the application with completely different expectations and incentives to search and shop. This is effectively a sweet spot for advertisers, as they know they’re getting top "real estate" advertisements.

With a simple search, you’re welcomed to a rich library of consumable ideas for health, gifts, beauty, travelling, home developments, and millions of other regularly marketed products that influence the home.

Pinterest users have an incredibly high willingness to engage as a function of using the platform as a power tool. This willingness to engage inevitably translates into a willingness to pay. Pinterest was not designed to make a user spend hours mindlessly scrolling for content to discover random nuggets of entertainment.

It was designed to make a sale and keep a customer happy outside of Pinterest so that the customer develops a positive relationship with the tool. That is fundamentally different from Facebook’s connect-everything approach to social-networking. It is less wasteful and more effective.

You may wonder why Pinterest essentially dominates the Google Images real estate when searching for images. This is a pretty complicated question to answer since the search engine optimization market is relatively new.

As a rule of thumb, try to imagine that Google Search is more or less "the web", where website links are the lifeblood to Google search. A good link is extremely valuable to Google.

Due to this relationship, it is in Google's interest to attempt to create a system that best serves their customer by offering the best, fastest, and most well-rounded results. This means that the most utilized or most well-developed websites are often the top results in a Google search.

This partially explains why searching for "Lebron James" today will result in search results by websites like Twitter, Wikipedia, Instagram, and other supersites. Similarly, searching for "Vegan food near me" will produce results by organizations like Yelp and Doordash.

There are many other reasons of course, but this is a rough rule of thumb; the more well-developed a website is, the more likely that it will dominate web search results. As the web progresses, the definition of well-developed changes.

An example of this is that Google begins to rank and prefer websites that implement privacy, page-load speed, and other important internet accessibility practices. This benefits organizations like Pinterest who develop tools like in-app browsers and support integration with applications like Zoom, Etsy, Shopify, and other large-scale platforms.

Why is Google doing this? Because they want high web standards as a global competitor and global leader of the internet. Part of the global competition is shaping the internet’s development to consider people that have high latency connections since software can scale faster than some of the hardware that is available around the globe.

The internet is ultimately the access to information, which is as statistically scarce as the access to clean water and sanitation around the globe. In this regard, Google and Facebook compete rather aggressively.

I totally love the fact that the network-effect behind Pinterest is built by women, but not necessarily for women. I am carefully monitoring the results of this network-effect as I believe that it will have long-term consequences on family life and scale as one of the most valuable internet properties similar to how Roblox breeched the family household and maintained relevancy over the years.

I feel that this kind of product design will eventually create a deeper gravity for advertisers, where they know that Pinterest and things like Roblox are a reliable and effective advertising space.

I use Facebook and Instagram every day, resulting in nothing. I regularly seek to delete it. I use Pinterest a few times a month at most. The difference is, every time I use Pinterest, I follow up or plan to follow up with some consumer behavior. And Facebook is pivoting itself to exist in such a way that it is impossible to delete. That, to me, is incredible.

These are essays that I wrote when I first started my career as a content creator. I started as a writer on Reddit in May 2020-2021. I had recently started investing in the stock market after many years of market-watching on the sidelines while I went to school and learn computer science.

I think a lot of these early actions are important even if they're outdated. There should be some consistent truth to what I'm saying. The difference should be depth. My introduction to the stock market was through products like Bitcoin, AMD, Paypal, Shopify, Tesla, Facebook and the like from 2016 onward. Not much has changed.

I think it's a great position to be in as a tech investor. I have the benefits of growing up with technology and in some ways I can kind of see that the internet was a child when I was a child and an adult when I was an adult.

It's great to have be on the horizon of seeing these companies perform in the market for that famous "10 year" amount and it's great being a customer of many of these organizations for up to 20 years.

Eventually, these essays will be improved upon - things change. You may see some of the changes already in other Patreon posts. They serve as domains of business or product knowledge. It should help you think about technology more too. Some essays are better than others.

I was writing for an audience that I largely did not care about and was constrained by that relationship. So some sections are more thoughtful than others to serve the relevancy matrix of the forum I was participating in.

Welcome to the metaverse!
TL;DR
Heutagogy - self-determined learning, is a student-centered instructional strategy that emphasizes the development of autonomy, capacity, and capability
Pedagogy - the method and practice of teaching, especially as an academic subject or theoretical concept.

Roblox is fundamentally an education company that encourages students to learn modern-day equivalents of typing on a computer. These skills involve things like learning how to code, develop art, or strong communication skills.

"We plan to continue to make acquisitions and investments in other companies, which could require significant management attention, disrupt our business, dilute our stockholders, and significantly harm our business. As part of our business strategy, we have made and intend to make acquisitions to add specialized employees and complementary companies, features, and technologies. For example, in 2020 we acquired Ceebr Limited, a company that operated a platform that teaches children age 6-13 to design, program, and play their own games." - Roblox S-1

Roblox acquisitions in education technology spaces

Video Games & Heutagogic Learning
It appears clear these days that video games are the most dominant form of media. This is because the video game industry can better access and more aggressively capture our high-barrier entry need for adventure and journey. Other industries compete with this element but ultimately place their customers in the spectator's seat.

For example:
The short stories on social media like Snapchat, Instagram, Youtube, or Twitter.
The hero tales created by Disney or Netflix.

Gaming as the leader in entertainment or media

One must remember that the attention-economy fundamentally depends on on key metric: engagement. It is no secret why organizations like Facebook, Google, Microsoft, or even Tesla have further intersected with gaming in aggressive maneuvers in recent years as a result of this economic condition.

Gaming is a big winner of the attention-economy and often sits at the frontier of new economies. When looking at age, gaming or other medias can be the shortest path to reaching new or lifelong customers. It is a lucrative and difficult position to acquire or maintain.

Think of it historically; during the first iterations of the web, many customers were fearful of putting credit-card information online while online gaming companies have ventured into selling branded debit cards that sold to children and youth that otherwise did not have access to banking. Roblox takes this nature a step further by effectively defining and supporting Robux-to-fiat economy as the lifeblood of the company.

First generation fintech and banking services
I’ve discussed internet media, user incentives, and their distinctions in a previous DD involving Pinterest. To highlight one of main ideas:

"An internet forum may take on a different medium, but it is ultimately a forum none the less. In my view, it ranks like the following list, where the top rank is the most inelastic due to human behavior. If we try to categorize it roughly, the forums would look like this:

Google is fueled by customer’s need for answered information.
Online video games are fueled by a customer’s need for adventure.
Reddit is fueled by a customer’s need for community.
Pinterest is fueled by a customer’s need for ideas.
Facebook is fueled by a customer’s need to connect."
In this DD, I would argue that gaming is one of the most comprehensive applications of internet forums that can encapsulate all of the needs above and dig deeper into the ideas that drive it.

The investment incentive: low barrier to entry & decentralized game development
In short, my view is that video games are one of the most powerful ways to engage students in a meaningful and long-lasting education, ranging from social to reading skills.

Heutagogic learning
Online games fulfill a similar shortcoming that traditional medias fail in regards to adventure or journey. In the same fashion, education and the art of teaching generally stutters when the student remains a spectator for too long.

What gaming achieves as an education service are all the critical requirements of a healthy STEM education:
The ability to inspire curiosity and confidence.
The ability to deeply engage.
The ability to produce imagination or creativity.

Some of us may scoff about this, but there is a lot of truth to this sentiment that I believe many would agree with. For many early online child creators, skills like typing quickly, bartering, multiplying, reading comprehension, or the desire to pursue arts originates from our time spent engaged by video games.

This is the goal and nature of heutagogic learning. This nature extends to adulthood, as many of us experienced this phenomenon while learning about advanced financial instruments for the sake of "learning the game" of stock market investing.

We spend time scowering through forums and generating a community no different than that of popular online games. Many of us have even acquired generational knowledge as a result of this media condition. We have met the proper requirements and incentives for a STEM education at scale.

Andragogic/Heutagogic learning at scale

I could talk length about this subject alone, but simply put, the world is not quite ready to accept such an idea.

Games are still seen as entertainment, but it typically evolves each generation. In my generation, three societal transformations occurred:
It stopped being weird to purchase in-game cosmetics.

The idea of watching others play video games was normalized.
E-Sports became popular and inspired a new economy.

Second generation online gaming

Some of these resistances are interesting when you look at it from a simpler lens. Why was it weird to watch others play video games online, when it was seemingly normal to watch someone play Dance Dance Revolution in an arcade or an older sibling progress through a game?

Why was it strange to purchase cosmetic goods where we spend a large percentage of our time in digital worlds? Why was it bizarre to see dedicated players compete at global levels when gaming and online access became a worldwide normalcy?

Usually there is no good reason for the psychological resistance to change.
Yet here we are, playing and learning effectively one of the most popular mobile games in the US.

STEAM Pedagogy - Arts in STEM

STEAM pedagogy for architecture, engineering, or construction
With that idea covered, I want to transition to examine one of the leading pedagogies in US education, which is the inclusion of arts in STEM, known as a STEAM pedagogy.

It may not be immediately clear why the inclusion is such a drastic change to STEM, but one should consider several factors:
STEM education standards are poor with low engagement (a societal problem)
Good science and engineering requires confident students (resisting imposter syndrome)
STEM requires creativity and imagination (critical thinking requisites)

Game development, code, or design
What an arts education does is fundamentally produce new language and learning skills that are actively applied in a STEM education. Typically speaking, arts is also far more engaging to youth while traditional STEM learning models can carry less obvious inherent incentives.

However, slowly but surely, we are beginning to see students who seek to learn digital art, coding, investing and other STEAM-derived interests that can transition into other branches of STEM as a result of incentivizing the desire to learn these skills.

A young Roblox game developer is only a short path away from finding a passion in architecture or cloud computing. This strategy is not new and has had success for organizations like Adobe, Microsoft, Autodesk, and other technical skills.

These are largely andragogic forms of learning, or adult-centered educations.
One of the most significant accomplishments of the inclusion of Arts in a STEM-centered education is the inversion of a question that afflicted many classrooms for generations:

“Why do I need to learn this?”
It turns out, the answer is not
“so you can become a scientist!”
but to provide an environment that encourages and incentivizes a proper learner's mentality
“I need to learn this, so that I can create that.”

Engineers and scientists are simply disciplined creators no different than an artist or performer. However, there are significant and clear barriers to entry to STEM-based and Arts-based learning. It is far more pragmatic for a child to inspire creative behaviors with a canvas, skateboard, or instrument while the barrier to entry for engineering practices may be far less accessible.

Some of this is partially a consequence of time, where there has been less knowledge transfer on writing software vs. writing prose and some of these barriers have compounding consequences at the socioeconomic level.

For example, there is a large disparity in big tech hirings, and such consequences can carry over to other multi-trillion dollar industries driven by infrastructure and Green New Deal policies.

Socioeconomic consequences in education support

Another huge barrier to entry to STEM is simply the fact that many students do not believe in themselves or have not been encouraged to imagine that they are capable of achieving success in subjects like mathematics and science, so there is an enormous amount of undue self-filtering in the field.

Learning how to dance is a far more engaging practice to a child, while learning how to code in some developer environment without the proper incentive may seem pointless. Organizations like Roblox can and are changing the equation for some students.

You may be at a loss at this point, but it's worth taking the time to simply ponder on this and what it means economically for Roblox. The language used here is directly aligned with the language used in the Roblox S-1 registration document:

Inspiration mentioned 9 times.
Create and inspiration mentioned 75 times.
Engagement mentioned 160 times.
This language is particular due to the game identifying with its original iteration, Interactive Physics, an education game that launched in 1989.

"The story of Roblox began in 1989 when our founders, David Baszucki and Erik Cassel, programmed a 2D simulated physics lab called Interactive Physics, which would later go on to influence our approach to building the groundwork for Roblox. Students across the world used Interactive Physics to see how two cars would crash, or how they could build destructible houses. In starting Roblox in 2004, we wanted to replicate the inspiration of imagination and creativity we saw in Interactive Physics on a much grander scale by ushering in a new category of human interaction that did not exist at the time."

1989
The Roblox Vision
"We focus our business on our developers, creators, and users, and acting in their interests in the long-term may conflict with the short-term expectations of analysts and investors."

EBP - Engagement Based Payouts started in 2020

In 2023: updates found here:
https://create.roblox.com/docs/production/monetization/economics#cash-payout-structure

Understanding the nature of modern-day cloud computing and its future direction will allow investors to understand the paths that Roblox will take. The fundamental theory of this economy is that a customer's data is an increasingly tangible asset. The way that I like to examine the economic output of this industry is by two core economic elements.

The value of work generated by machine-to-machine transactions (network output).
The value of data and services generated by human experiences (customer input).

Serverless computing - network service architecture for real-time and powerful apps.
There are many organizations that capture the essence of this industry. Organizations like Square and Zoom will provide services that we're all familiar with, but we often forget the under-hood-details that exist and govern the infrastructure of these companies.

What cloud computing organizations have realized is that as our engagement with platforms increases, the value of our data and needs becomes increasingly tangible. Our needs for financial technology or property rentals have resulted in regulatory or social challenges, which we typically refer to as "disruption". The disruption is rooted in the fact that our data is an authentically tangible good.

This idea that our data and time spent on digital platforms is the central hypothesis behind creation of the robux system that Roblox lives on.

There are many things that Roblox needs to accomplish in the near to short term to achieve long-term profitability and the leadership seems to have a clear vision on how to achieve that:
The company will continue to redistribute its wealth back toward its developers.
The company will aggressively invest in education sectors to incentivize students to learn valuable skills.
The company will support wildly successful games as a way to create a long-term identity for Roblox (like popular Nintendo games)
The company will continue to invest in its cloud platform and eventually develop its own hardware platform to reduce its expenses.

The reason that I'm certain of this is because the organization needs to accomplish the following incentives and financial feats:
Reached a large enough audience in order to maintain long-term relevancy.
Produced and support games that create enough incentive to join the platform.
Created enough incentives for developers to produce quality experiences.

"Roblox has a vibrant economy built on a currency called Robux, which can be purchased through the Roblox Client and website. Users can also acquire Robux through a monthly subscription to Roblox Premium. Developers and creators earn Robux by selling access to virtual content. Developers can also earn Robux by driving engagement of Premium subscribers through an engagement-based payout system. When Premium subscribers spend time in a developer’s experience, that developer earns a prorated share of the user’s monthly subscription fee. Engagement-based payouts incentivize developers to invest in the engagement of their experiences. Roblox allows developers and creators to convert earned Robux into the real-world currency of their choice through our Developer Exchange Program."

In my view, Roblox's 2020 premium payout system will be one the biggest shifts in media as it has many potential outcomes that we aren't fully implemented yet. This is the nature of certain powerful architectures like computing more data at the edge or leaning on services like Fastly, Amazon Fargate, or other serverless/back-end platforms. Roblox is no such stranger to this and I would say that they certaintly have a vested interest in pushing these kinds of interactions.

Some uses cases of engagement-based payouts are repeatable to other platforms, where organizations like Reddit could easily implement similar financial logic if they discover that Reddit Subscribers spend the majority of their time to a small concentration of subreddits. This already exists to an extent, where users represent engagement through coin-sharing and reddit emoji placements.

Another example, if a high-quality education game were to be released on Roblox, where the developer agrees to redistribute their earned Robux to schools in need, then Roblox has achieved an economy where a student who is spending time learning has resulted in the improvement or construction of other learning facilities. This is also reflective of the idea that data is increasingly tangible.

The possibilities with an engagement-based payout system are enormous for Roblox and produces added value to the ideas behind things like virtual concerts, streams, or other experiences that aren't fully realized in the gaming sector. For example, what is the economic consequence of children having a safe environment to attend concerts of their favorite artists?

At the same time, the Robux payout system is a non-trivial distance away from creating applications of other alternative currencies like exchanging Robux with other digital assets like VBucks, tickets, or block-you-know-what-based applications.

Another core element to Roblox's financial future is to ultimately secure its means of distribution. As it currently stands, the biggest expense to the Roblox platform is the fee processing it must agree to when it comes to doing business with organizations like Apple, Microsoft, Google, and other payment processors like Visa and Paypal. One way to reduce these costs and increase profitability is to develop products akin to the Nintendo Switch or Oculus platform.

This idea is not too far away given the nature of Roblox's business, which has an enormous amount of various types of games that would be well-suited by Roblox partnerships. Overtime, the value of Apple or Google's distribution power weakens as the company cements itself into public consciousness.

The company has alluded to this idea with an April fool's joke in 2019, with a console known as the imagination-powered Robox:
" At Roblox, we’re continuously exploring new and innovative ways to bring our platform to millions of people across the world.

Just as we’ve expanded onto phones, tablets, the Xbox One, and virtual reality, we believe that there’s an even greater potential just waiting to be unlocked. A new way to experience all your favorite Roblox games. A new way to connect with your friends. A new way to make your dreams a reality in stunning, 8K ultra-high definition graphics and at greater than 120 frames per second.

Welcome to a new era of interactive entertainment. This is Robox."

Conclusion
There was a lot of ground to cover here so let's briefly review. Gaming is arguably the best form of media in the attention-economy where Roblox identifies itself at the intersection of education and digital media development.
A significant portion of the education sector is focused on STEAM pedagogy which aligned with and supported by Roblox goals long-term. Roblox is able to leverage cloud computing to disrupt traditional models in gaming, education, financial technology, and imagination markets.

Some essays are better than others. I was writing for an audience that I largely did not care about and was constrained by that relationship. So some sections are more thoughtful than others to serve the relevancy matrix of the forum I was participating in.

Investing in Internet Forums
Let’s keep one question in mind:
Did Facebook’s implementation of a hashtag kill Twitter?

Ultimately, what drives a social-networking site is a user’s incentive to search and discover information in that particular forum. As a result, examining social-networking sites can be a lot like comparing shopping centers, such that a shopper is incentivized to go to a location for a particular reason that is served by that institution.

Pinterest uses pins, Reddit uses subreddits, and Google uses links - all having unique advantages as a means to distribute information.

Pinterest-as-a-Search-Service
The forum may take on a different medium, but it is ultimately a forum none the less. If we try to categorize it roughly, the forums would look like this:
Google is fueled by user’s need for answered information.

Facebook is fueled by a user’s need to connect.
Pinterest is fueled by a user’s need for ideas.
Reddit is fueled by a user’s need for community.
Online video games are fueled by a user’s need for adventure.

The power of incentives
With this basic model, you can argue which forum may be inelastic. In my view, it ranks like this, where the top rank is the most inelastic due to human behavior:
Google (need for information)
Games (need for adventure)
Reddit (need for community)
Pinterest (need for ideas)
Facebook (need to connect)

The reason I rank Facebook as the most elastic version is because I have already witnessed multiple transformations resulting in users connecting in various ways in an attention-economy (Myspace, Twitter, Discord, TikTok, Roblox).

I eventually expect this to replicate in other nations too. I also believe that people really underestimate how quickly humans find new ways to connect and can move to another platform for connection; which is quite a common occurrence in online gaming.

I also believe that its physical network advantage is growing thinner.

Instagram entered Shops to compete with Pinterest, not Amazon.
Take some time to think about why this relationship exists.
Searching
Consider this economic relationship.
What are the demographics of male underwear shoppers and who do male underwear brands market to? Women. Why?

That being said, I think Pinterest is wonderfully positioned and has quite an interesting history. The network-effect that built Pinterest was mostly driven by women, which has profound economic consequences across global households.

What this ultimately results in product education, where families learn how to use Pinterest as a tool and search engine for ideas, rather than a local-friendgroup site. As a result, Pinterest’s recommendation model is geared to advertise to women-influenced interests, which we will touch on shortly.

An incredible economic relationship occurring at global scale.
This has long-term positive consequences for product messengers regardless of culture.

You can try it yourself to understand; it feels like what you want Google Images to do for you at times:

- Recipe, Exercise, and Diet ideas (Peloton)
- Birthday gift ideas (Michaels, Corsair)
- Skincare ideas (Target, Hims & Hers)
- Tips for traveling to another area (AirBnB)
- Home construction (Sherwin-Williams, James hardie)
- Omnichannel support from places like TikTok, Zoom, Etsy

Corsair Setup Ideas: note links to Wayfair and Reddit.House Interior Paint: note links to BERH, Sherwin-Williams, Etsy, and Pinterest Shops.
The fact is, it’s the user who is actually voluntarily searching for ads in an ad space.

Behaviorally, this means that Pinterest’s users are in a “high willingness to engage” with things that result in “action”. That is, a Pinterest user is logging in because they need to start something or they need to plan for something in the near future.

This is basically a sweet spot for advertisers, as they know they’re getting top real estate on BOTH Google and Pinterest as a result of their product design.

Pinterest users have an incredibly high “willingness to engage” as a function of using the social platform as a useful tool above all else.
Pinterest was not designed to make a user spend hours mindlessly scrolling for content.

It was designed to make a sale and keep a customer happy outside of Pinterest. That is fundamentally different than Facebook’s connect-everything approach to social-networking.

The Design
Pinterest ranks high in Google’s results for specific reasons. Pinterest develops its own in-app browser that has particular consequences for:
Security & Privacy
High demand for high quality ad-messaging and visuals
Vectors to user’s websites generated by hosts like Shopify, Walmart, or other omnichannels.
Vectors for advertisers
A browser that follows Progressive Web App standards

Progressing Web Standards
The combination of these design choices ranks it high in “Google’s algorithm”, while this search engine result increases its bar for ranking each year. This means that bigger organizations like Twitter, DDash, and Pinterest will enjoy the tailwinds of these priorities.

Why is Google doing this? Because they want high web standards as a global competitor. Part of the global competition is shaping the internet’s develop to consider people that have high latency connections since software can scale faster than some of the hardware that is available around the globe.

The internet is ultimately “access to information”, which is as scarce as “access to clean water” around the globe. So it’s carefully considered in strong engineering communities.
Summary
I totally love the fact that the network-effect behind Pinterest is built by women, but not necessarily for women. I am carefully monitoring the results of this network-effect as I believe that it will have long-term consequences on family life.

I feel that this kind of product design will eventually create a deeper gravity for advertisers, where they know that Pinterest users are essentially sustainable top-dollar advertising spaces; as users are looking directly to consume as a result of their usage which is far different than other social-media platform strategies.

I use Facebook and Instagram every day, resulting in nothing. I use Pinterest a few times a month at most. The difference is, every time I use Pinterest - I follow up or plan to follow up with some consumer behavior. That, to me, is incredible.
