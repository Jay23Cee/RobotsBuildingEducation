# Focused Investing

Investing in stocks is ultimately a science in making decisions. Focused investing is the practice I follow - so the most I can ultimately do for you here is provide you with timeless wisdom and examples of the practice so that you can start off on the right foot. So let's jump right into it.

### 1. Diversification is protection against ignorance.

Focused investing is the opposite of diversification. You should still start diversified. In general, the less aware you are, the more you should diversify. Protection against ignorance is an extremely powerful thing and you ought to get in the habit of realizing that you will always know very little relative to the ebbs and flows of information that exist.

Most people simply don't have the time to pour of books and readings, so they allow financial advisors to manage their funds via 401k retirement accounts or various highly regarded indexes and ETFs like the S&P500. These investments are essentially large bundles that are tied to the overall market performance.

**It's extremely important to start here.** It's the best starting position because you're more or less investing in an advanced algorithm that's selecting for the best possible average. That's a great deal for most people. If all your investments end up being diversified ones, that's fine. That's still focused investing if you make that informed decision.

But what's the next phase after that? Well, let's say you're extremely interested in investing in "green energy markets" or "cybersecurity markets". There are ETFs for that - so start there. But as you can see, you narrowed down an entire level with this practice already.

To summarize, you need to more or less understand the nature of numbers to appreciate diversification and it's complement, focused investing. Focused investing provides more volatility, but it's crucial to remember that volatility is not risk. Diversification is a reduction of volatility. In short, don't drive fast until you're a trained driver.

### 2. The more that you read, the more successful you will be.

At the end of the day, you're going to be reading encyclopedias of information as you build a network of knowledge of the moving pieces that exist within companies and the relationship they have to the market. This isn't to promote endless analysis before making a choice, although it may come to that like it did for me, but to promote exploration of ideas that you have.

You will inevitably read through numerous public market filings, annual reports and quarterly reports. You're going to inevitably start mapping out all of the numbers that govern the performance of a business. You will know when you've read enough about a company or market because your imagination and the creativity of your questions will simply plummet.

### 3. Control your bias

The single biggest problem you will have on this journey is controlling for bias. Bias in an extremely powerful and invisible force that governs our ability to make decisions. It's sneaky too - for example, someone may read the last wisdom and decide to read a book about Steve Jobs only to confirm their already existing bias about Apple and drive them toward investment. You need to be extremely careful here because this is pretty much the ultimate challenge you'll face as an investor.

One of the biggest challenges here is understanding what you think you know vs. what you really know. If you're following me closley along, you'll start to make connections between protecting yourself from ignorance, reading a lot and controlling your understanding. It's a pretty good recipe for success if you ask me!

As always, I recommend listening to the Harvard Lecture by Charlie Munger called "The Psychology Of Human Misjudgement". I would argue it's one of the greatest lectures in history.

### 4. Understand incentives

Understanding incentives is the next most difficult challenge behind picking stocks. You need to understand why people do things. That is tricky and disappointing process and it as complicated as advanced multivariable calculus. But once you have a solid grasp of that, you know why organizations like Pinterest can exist happily along organizations like Instagram and Amazon.

Another key knowledge point here is understanding that changing the incentive changes the behavior. We as a species are simply hard-wired to adapt and take-risks, so changing the reason why people do that will help you understand why businesses are choosing to work on particular things.

This isn't simply a macro-level observation. For example, you wouldn't make inform decision because "electric vehicles are the future and people won't want to pay for gas". Although that's true, it's not particularly compelling. Understanding incentives will have you understand seemingly unreasonable market standards like American's unwillingness to exchange their iPhone devices. Understanding a company's incentives will ultimately have you understand whether or not you're in a safe place to invest money.

### 5. Study the greats

Similar to wisdom 2, you ought to pick the right role models and influences. This is true for anything, but particularly true for the stock market. As a general rule of thumb, the closer you are to money, the more value that trust has. So don't simply pick popular models, pick ones that worked hard to earn your trust.

I recommend to start with Charlie Munger, Warren Buffet, Jack Bogle and Cathie Wood. They are all exceptional figures in their own way that have greatly influenced many investors across time. They will provide other insights to consider. You may discover your own over time, but most would agree that there is meaningful information to be learned from these folks.

You could try not to study the greats and figure it out on your own. You may even get lucky too, but what you're ultimately doing is practicing the art of walking into an arena to get slaughtered by a lion. It's not a very reasonable decision.

### Conclusion I

So to keep the practice going, I'm going to keep it to 5 simple points. It may take you years to process fully the depth here and they're really omnipresent pieces of wisdom that will help you as an investor or entrepeneur alike. I can continue on and on about other things, but investing in the stock market is ultimately an identity problem. You are different than me, and so is your temperament and risk-taking clock.

Like coding, the point isn't about just writing software - there's a bigger conversation here about how and why you invest in things that aren't stocks. These are your relationships, where you live, what you practice and any number of other time commitments that you make. If I had to offer one last piece of wisdom - fight like living hell to secure your right to health, time and space before money. Sometimes life has you focusing on money but keep your vision clear - you don't want to learn the hard way why health and time is more important. It'll keep you humble and honest.

So let's dive in shall we? What do I invest in and why?

# The Portfolio

In the spirit of the tradition, we're going to briefly cover my investments. In the future, there may be a better time and place to dive into all of these concepts more closely but for now, this should all take quite some time to really internalize. Before starting I want the reader to illustrate to remember an idea. Investing your money as an adult is essentially the equivalent of a child learning how to swim. Any fool can examine a deep body of water and understand that their is some inherent risk in trying to learn how to swim but the task is ultimately not that big of a deal. The same goes for investing. You typically just need some experience and guidance. I think a lot of people like to believe that investing is like jumping into a sea filled with sharks. It can be that if you want it to be but it's obviously a nonsensical thing to do to put yourself in that kind of situation. In fact, you could give someone like me $500,000,000 and I would likely be able to allocate that money and sleep soundly at night knowing that the market isn't going to suddenly vanquish any of it.

One of the wisdoms I follow, not listed above, is one provided by Munger and Buffet. They suggest not to directly invest in things outside of your circle of competence.
This piece of wisdom took me a while to understand, which lead me to the advice I provided earlier about really taking the time to understand what you know vs. what you think you know.

So I invest in social media, financial technology and education technology. I believe those industries have non-trivial growth trajectories ahead of them and I believe that I can understand these investments better than the typical investor. Despite having a background in computer science, I don't expand into seemingly common sense investments like semiconductor chips or AI - but that simply points to the practice of investing in what you truly know. I don't truly spend too much time working on AI or pouring over modern advancements so I don't extend myself in those directions!

When it comes to these industries, I generally invest in assets that are offered at fair or good prices. This is another wisdom not listed about investing in wonderful companies at fair prices, rather than fair companies at wonderful prices. But what is wonderful? In my opinion, it's some combination of having deep market penetration, a profoundly good reputation and excellent product marketing.

These are great American companies like Costco, Apple, Disney and the sort. We may recognize the value of the brands, but why is it that we recognize these brands so much?
So when it comes to applying these concepts, I've ultimately boiled it down to primarily 5 investments. And if you're wondering, yes I've done deep reading on every company, their financials, their history, their leaders and the overarching stories:

1. Pinterest
2. Block
3. Duolingo
4. Berkshire Hathaway
5. Apple

### Understanding Pinterest & Social Media

https://profitviz.com/PINS

Well before going into Pinterest, let's understand the basics of social media. All of social media exists on some kind of "scale of intention" ranging from direct action to passive entertainment. So applications like Discord, Google and Pinterest are going to be geared toward pre-determined customers goals; they're social tools. Other platforms will likely be geared toward some form of entertainment like Tiktok or Instagram. They're passive tools where people enjoy spending their idle time.

Now social media has a super set, which is the creator economy, and that's much larger in scope. The creator economy can even be inclusive of things like Roblox, AirBnB or even this simple AI tutor. A creator is a digital-first entrepeneur. There are many too many ways to measure success in the creator economy and I personally believe that millenials and younger generations should really be proud of creating such a fascinating slice of the pie.

Pinterest lies in a healthy place in the creator economy. It's customers love to use the application for the right reasons and it's primarily driven by women. In short, it's a shopping application. Underneath that it's an idea search engine and a place to collect plans. This combination of things places it uniquely in the creator economy.

Let me ask the reader this - if you had to choose one tool to plan the best version of a child's birthday party; would you use Pinterest, Amazon or Google? What about a wedding, or a vacation? The thing about these question is that it's not immediately obvious, and that is economically profound when you realize that Google and Amazon are both nearly 10,000%+ or 100x+ larger than Pinterest.

So despite being smaller, and theoretically more volatile, you end up in a pleasant situation where a reputable company continues to grow in a manner that is clear-sighted. Before Pinterest is concerned with social influence, it's concerned with providing it's customers a useful service. This creates a very simple business to understand and the second order effects of these relationships results in highly curated ads. Customers on Pinterest are directly interested in the ads rather than it being a competing space for time and attention.

Financially, this theory is playing out well. Pinterest has an impressive outreach of 400M-500M monthly users with a healthy balance sheet. Many other social media competitors of a similar size like Snapchat, Spotify, Discord, Reddit X seemingly struggle in comparison, and for good reason - they're incentivized around capturing attention and building an economy around it - of which Google and Meta are heavyweights.

So the theory is ultimately pretty simple. Pinterest is a predictable business and as long as it remains highly reputable and useful, it becomes a pretty good social media investment that can responsibly manage heavy allocation.

### Understanding Block & Financial Technology

https://profitviz.com/SQ

So over time, you'll notice that my investment strategy tends to revolve around the "next best opportunity" rather than the current incumbents. This means that I like trying to formulate which opportunities are likely to be the next generation of competitors. This is the reason why I tend to have seemingly random investments like Roblox. Block is one of those investments. I believe there's an opportunity that it can become the next generation "JP Morgan Chase or Visa".

Investing in financial technology is honestly pretty complex. For example, if you want to understand the distribution of financial services, you need to understand the regulatory frameworks that allow those pipelines to be built. This goes back to our first principle - reading is going to lead to success. However, for now, let's make this break down the complex and then follow it with something more simple to understand.

The theory here is that technology is clearly a creative facilitator and improver of previous financial systems. That part is clear as day and a simple sign of that is the improvement of large banking applications like Chase and the rise of smaller neobanks like Robinhood. The important key here is the fact that technology is a **creative** facilitator and will thus be a crucial part to the larger creator economy. Block, I believe, understands this much more clearly than its peer organizations like Paypal, Robinhood or even Shopify. It is important for me to distinguish that Block isn't the only organization that understands this, but Block understands it best.

I'll ask to the reader to really think deeply about this. What is finance? What use does it serve to the world? It's just a man made construct - it doesn't fundamentally achieve anything other than a system that we're usually in agreement with. Art is similar in that regard in the sense that it doesn't fundamentally critical for our survival like the production of food or the maintenance of clean water.

But it's important to appreciate these elements of the economy. These are facilitating forces. This is actually why Block investing in TIDAL was a pretty wise thing to do, since it builds organic relationships with a critical part to the creator economy. Cultural and social capital, if wielded well, keeps an organization relevant across changes over time. Many in the industry look for the famous iPhone moment, but I would suggest to consider the iPod moments too :)

Other than the cultural and regulatory complexity, let's review the simple to understand parts about financial services. Deposits and credit facilitation is important. Building deposits allows companies to create lending and credit capacity. It's a profoundly simple concept. Businesses will have various ways to incentivize customers to keep their deposits at their institution organization.

For the sake of review - we can observe that new institutions like Robinhood incentivize their customers by offering financial instruments in the stock market. Block primarily incentivises deposits for simple app transactions on Cash App and Square incentives deposits via small business growth. Again, I encourage readers to appreciate the simplicity of these things. I would also encourage you to consider how some features like "direct deposits" is actually a deeply competitive thing - because if Cash App is getting your employer deposit, that's a whole deposit that Chase bank suddenly misses on their balance sheet!

It's this simplicity that actually makes financial services failure so epicly nonsensical. There is almost no case where financial institution fail unless they engage in extremely wreckless behavior, because the foundation of financial services is ultimately being a good steward of money created and distributed. This has historically been true from the fall of Silicon Valley Bank to the infamous financial market meltdown of 2008. So therein lies the reality of choosing a good financial service - they must be superb financial stewards. Keeping things simple is the right way.

Now the real meat and bones behind Block is their research behind Bitcoin. This brings us to discussions related to disruptive theories. I don't want to spend too much time their, but this is really where focused investing comes into play. There is a lot I can say about Bitcoin but I think at this point we can ultimately view it, or its consequence, as an inevitable. I believe that Block is built in such a manner that they're most likely to achieve the right outcome. Block is appopriately focused on the decentralized network aspect rather than the programmable money aspect. This focus is what may ultimately have them competing directly with financial networks like Visa, which is greater than 1000% or 10x of Block's current size.

Why am I convinced of this? Well, again, it's pretty simple. Block serves small businesses on and offline. Many small businesses today are part of this digital-first entrepeneur ethos for the creator economy. Looking back at history, we can observe how network injustices can harm businesses, ranging from the legal shutdown of Tiktok to billionaire buyouts of platforms like Twitter. At a microlevel, we can observe simple bans, restrictions or other algorithmic serving demands and their consequences on business income.

Block isn't the only financial service that is digitally native and acutely aware of the times. Shopify is another particular company in the same realm that is arguably more successful online. But therein lies my appreciation for Blocks approach - I think there is something uniquely special about technology companies that build solutions for the real world.

### Understanding Duolingo & Education Technology

Education technology is one of those things that baffles technologists because it's seemingly impossible to disrupt the classroom. This is something I've dedicated a lot of time to understand and I started the journey with a pretty simple concept - education is centered around a student's experience.

It's difficult to change the classroom because the classroom is a collection of individuals with random relationship dynamics informed by their surroundings. So developing technology for the classroom often falls short of expectations and it isn't a very intuitive thing to understand. This is why, despite several technological revolutions, the classroom remains awfully resilient to change. Simply put, the delivery content is not enough for technology to improve outcomes systemically.
It's important to remember the foundation of this subject - education is centered around a students experience. We tend to segment the conversation into different branches, which are pretty much varying levels of constraints introduced to a student or their classrooms. But education is far more economic than that and is tied closer to the limited experience we have as people. Consider, for example, the market crash invoked by the COVID pandemic - such an experience incentivized people around the world to learn about the stock market. Consider the existential crisis that many students encounter "choosing" a study in their college careers.

Duolingo may be a company is capable of achieving that extraordinary outcome. To illustrate the impact we're talking about, this organization is positioned to provide literacy solutions for global audiences wanting to learn English or any other dominant business language. It has compelling market conditions worth observing beyond an American perspective of the value of language learning.

![DLR_Chart-Most-popular-language-Map (1)](https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/assets/65219666/43271dca-d6f9-4444-a64c-5b71b7461fac)

![The_number_of_people_below_different_poverty_lines svg (1)](https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/assets/65219666/f500bf99-68ab-4cb1-b66c-d34327fb6c96)

The organization created an ever-improving game representing a learning journey that allowed it to penetrate the consumer market internationally, which is a rare achievement for a formal education technology company. This affords it a profoundly long roadmap. This really places the company close to the first mile of learning in general, since speech is one of the first skills we acquire in our life journey.

The big risk with this approach is that it just about requires consumer level adoption in order for it to survive as a publicly traded company. One of my early attitudes in education technology development was to avoid the temptation to depend on gamification. I held a conservative attitude after watching audiences ebb and flow between popular online video games and I determined that most education technology companies were developing pretty bad games. Duolingo likely understood this and delivered a modest approach centered around retention and practice.

The company operates in a much broader manner than other paid services that try to solve more local problems, like homework helping platforms. The freemium model placed them in a unique position as an effective edutainment company. It became a meme. This allowed it to take a chaotic but productive direction with popular culture and public consciousness.

![wordpress-header-4 (1) (1)](https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/assets/65219666/55348124-0117-4815-825c-f20fd7ef4b1d)

So to summarize, it has a compelling business case and has achieved extraordinary market positioning that no education technology has really achieved. It took an enormous risk in its approach, an approach that takes a significant amount of time to get right, and appears to be executing on the approach correctly. It has a moat.

This focus on literacy has second-order effects that seal the deal for me. It added recent services to teach the foundations of music and mathematics. This is a strong signal that they have a repeatable recipe for success to multiply the growth of their business. These subjects also push Duolingo further into PC markets since things like math and music are popular demands for elementary and high school classrooms devices. This push makes it more likely that Duolingo can expand to other mediums and forms for other subjects like coding, history or any other learning enrichment.

On top of this, Duolingo is a lean startup. It was run by 95 people by the time it approached 1 billion in worth. Today it has roughly 600 employees. This is a signal that they are effective at allocating capital and utilizing resources. It's the kind of environment that would use ChatGPT to improve their company before improving their product. For the most part, the numbers check out.

![ba19ab1a-cdef-47c1-9220-9fba3043a91b_1544x738 (1)](https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/assets/65219666/204bcd9b-a3d8-4524-95cb-8c3dd841c14f)

Duolingo is an expensive stock as of September 2023. From an investor point of view, the market is charging a significant premium for two primary reasons. Duolingo carries positive sentiment with OpenAI's influence over the tech industry. It's also growing rapidly. The market is essentially confident that the company will continue rapid growth and its current expensive pricing is a temporary placeholder to capture it. At current rates, we'll see Duolingo operating 1 billion in revenue in the next 2 to 3 years. This places current investors in a risky situation where investors need to determine whether the opportunity cost is worth it.

Growth stocks are tricky because the ultimate goal is to effectively capture the market. At times people will express confusion by organizations like Tesla being valued at seemingly absurd levels, but that's because the market is pricing in confidence that and industry will be captured. It's at that point that the organization has to maintain confidence in order to not crash, and part of that is achieved through the numbers. In Tesla's case, it retained dominance, while it did not in Zoom's case.

![image (12) (1)](https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/Educate/assets/65219666/f1d166b7-6b01-4361-8457-556543d8130b)

In my view, it's a difficult thing to execute on. I'm currently focused on burn rate for the growth of Robots Building Education, so I'm experiencing some level of additional restraint and fiscal conservatism. It is difficult to justify paying a premium today but can also see the argument that the current rate of growth would change the conversation where current prices are cheap. So the stock is currently at the top of the watchlist. Appropriate valuation would cement it at the level that Block and Pinterest, which carries a "buy as much as you can and try to sell as little as humanely possible over time" sentiment. For now, the decision is complex and based on your own risk assessment and bias, but I am eager to add it to the "RO.B.E Portfolio"

education technology is with one simple statement; what else is education other than a student's experience?

### Understanding Finance & Berkshire Hathaway

https://profitviz.com/BRK-A

Berkshire hathaway is somewhat complex to understand. It is one of the "incumbents" or market leadrs. These investments are at times necessary when seeking to diversify or counterbalance risk. It's an enormous decentralized network of unrelated businesses ranging from Dairy Queen to GEICO insurance that fuels investments into individual stocks. In a nutshell, investing in Berkshire is like investing in the industrial production of compounding returns.

It's pretty fascinating because despite the business model of having aggressive invesments like a 40% holding in Apple, most investors would consider Berkshire to be a financially conservative institution and many prefer to invest in Berkshire instead of the overall market. This is Berkshire investors are confident that their money is being used wisely rather than optimally. So the point of investing in Berkshire isn't particularly for its growth opportunity.

Understanding that base then lets your understand how Berkshire approaches money. It generally invests in heavy cash and inelastic generating businesses like insurance, railroads and energy. They then grab this cash and essentially invest it to take stake into stocks or securities in the market. These stocks tend to follow a simple model, where Berkshire will generally invest in extremely high reputation organizations like Apple, Coca Cola, Heinz-Kraft or Bank of America.

Hopefully at this point you start to consider that intelligence isn't really what you want in the market, it's wisdom. You don't want to select for the smartest investment. You want to select for the most common sense one. The answer you're looking for tends to be in front of you for a reason.

### Understanding Apple & Technology

https://profitviz.com/AAPL

It's pretty simple to describe Apple. Apple is another of the epic incumbents. The way I like to describe apple is "industrial mastery". If you consider the lifetime value of family spend on Apple devices are services, one could argue that individuals spend as much on Apple products than they do closing a deal on the home they live in. I think that really puts the wealth of these devices into perspective.

Apple is interesting in the sense that it began to lead the American market, when historically that position belonged to large industrial institutions like General Electric or General Motors. Frankly, it makes sense that it leads. They sell personal devices and services with those devices. It helps to think of those devices as "vehicles to services". This is also what makes the growth of Tesla particularly legendary, since it became that "next generation disruptor" with relatively extreme lifetime value.

As a side note, One interesting practice I like to do is look at the top companies over time and observe the nature of market leaders. There is a degree of common sense there: industrials, technology and financials tend to lead the market. It is the natural economy of global society. I think this is a good practice for understanding the macroeconomic side of the market. You should almost always understand what makes market leaders lead, because it is **always** a profound condition. Then, and only then, is it possible to find other opportunities.

### Conclusion II

Well truthfully, there isn't much to touch on when it comes to incumbents like Berkshire and Apple. They're massive and elite corporations, so it usually just helps to understand how they got there in order to figure out how they're staying there. The smaller businesses are opportunities, but that also requires deep understanding of their relative position in the market.

You may have noticed that I didn't dive much into the financial reporting of these companies. That's because financial reporting is backtracked data. It's the outcome of the understanding and the execution of the business. So it's about keeping up appropriately, but I don't believe in using financial reporting to convince people of a good investment. That part is obvious, you ought to not take too much stake into something with poor or risky financials unless it's you driving the business, but that's a whole other conversation we'll have another day.

As always, you can expect the depth, the details and the quality of this content to improve over time. I believe this is a good faith attempt at getting the most important thoughts on this matter in a clear way and the challenge with this content was thematically always picking out the right parts. Please do take your own time to understand this and apply it to things in and outside of stocks, since it has been multiple and continuous years of effort to consolidate it to this point! I look forward to improving this essay as things change over time :)
