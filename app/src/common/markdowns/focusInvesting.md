You know I always struggle so much with this one and after some rounds of therapy it's starting to be clear why. I started off as a content creator n 2020 as a writer on Reddit. I wrote about stocks and I was excited to introduce topics about technology that I felt people weren't aware of. I felt that I had an interesting relationship with understanding the market and how technology plays in it.

It's such a risky thing to do but "figuring out the answer of which stocks to pick" is such a lucrative thing that many people foolishly tried. This particular problem was something that eluded me from the beginning of Robots Building Education. I felt that I could teach people the right principles to investing, create investors and hopefully have them re-invest back into me. It's kind of a ridiculous concept and I never really knew how to finally "launch" it.

Well, what you see online is Robots Building Education, so I'm doing what I believe is right for this to work. It needs to be efficient and it needs to be push the boundary of what's capable. The goal is to make you a better investor, not to tell you what to invest in. Please, obsessively read everything about these businesses and their competitors to understand more.
So here goes nothing. 3 years of a lot of painstaking effort, stated clearly.

## The Stock Portfolio

<img width="311" alt="Screen Shot 2023-04-21 at 1 12 20 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65219666/233803430-b4d93024-a20b-47e9-a87e-cb7317e38098.png">


I'm not going to go into all of the details of the things I learned. There are so many rules and regulations that define how I choose things.
In short, it helps to think of the market and businesses in terms of economic pipelines. There is a pipeline for everything, from the production of silk to music label regulations.They're pipelines of economic activity. Which pipelines look good to invest in?

Here is one thing I attribute a lot in the game of stock picking. Stewardship. Focusing on those things will help you address bias over the long term in the stock market.

1. Berkshire Hathaway (20%)
   Berkshire Hathaway is an empire investment. I view Berkshire as actively invested American cash, so it's the first stock that I would trade in or sell. I invest in Berkshire because it's not an investment that I try to beat the market with, it's an investment of an organization and model that I trust.

   They make money via highly profitable business across sectors like insurance, railroad, industrials, banking and consumer staples. They invest that money back into stocks.

2. Apple (30%)
   Apple sells personal devices and extends them with services. Their products are ultimately centered around personal, private and self-investing technology. Similar to Berkshire Hathaway, they're invested in as a trusted place to store wealth.

   Many investors tend to understand Apple's walled garden approach. I don't focus on that. They're in the business of creating private devices for consumers. This causes their products to center around privacy. I believe long term, consumers will value privacy-centric technology over social ones like Google and Meta.

3. Pinterest (20%)
   Pinterest is a social network and search engine built around shopping, ideas and planning for the future. Women largely use it as a productivity tool. I believe that the value of their brand, reputation and economic incentives will result in creating one of the strongest advertisement networks.

   In fact, it would not be surprising to see if more iPhone users allow Pinterest to collect their data over other less trusted networks like Instagram and Tiktok. Why? I recommend to think of social networks, ranging from Instagram to Amazon's Prime network, on a spectrum. The spectrum is defined by intention and entertainment.

   Which networks are best at driving revenue? Which networks have designed an environment that's most productive for advertisements? Which network has the most influence over consumer awareness? How can that all change? When you think about networks from that perspective, you get to observe a lot of different constraints and advantages that some have over others.

4. Block (30%)
   Block invests into primarily small businesses and individuals and reinvests their money into Bitcoin research. I believe there is a future of banking and that programmable money is a clear facet of life and I believe that Block is positioned to be a good steward of that future. There's also reality, where large banks like Chase and Bank of America are likely to persist and flourish too. I'm not much a zero-sum thinker when it comes to the competitive environment. I believe that it's likely that all major banking players are more likely to succeed than to fail.

That being said, the nature of banking is how well an organization manages deposits and risks. Block is a company that does a few things very well and manages its risk by offering safer financial services. It then offsets this risk by investing into Bitcoin research rather than depending on crypto's success to succeed as a company. It's still a classical financial services company.

I believe that their investments in Bitcoin will eventually pay off, and will allow them to grow vertically in a domain that many other companies are only investing partially into, names organizations like Visa, Mastercard and Chase. In fact, I believe that Block has the potential to be one of the largest organizations in the world in the future, if the status quo of organizations like Google, Apple and Microsoft achieve complete oligarch control of consumer technology.

I hope that you can appreciate some of the nuance and diversification in this 4 stock portfolio. If you do a deep dive into every business, I believe you will learn an enormous amount about the market. I will eventually write more on these if needed, but it's much lower priority. In the meantime, this will be the foundation of RO.B.E's financial arm, and I will be heavily investing into it.

As I mentioned earlier, I'm not going into great detail behind my process. The truth is I just spent an incredible amount of time reading about the market. It is difficult to explain. It's also difficult to summarize. Some rules are more important than others. It helps to think about the pipelines you're investing in.

When I had lower wealth, I was pretty good at picking out which things would result in exponential returns. I still do some of that, but I have more mastery over the subject now, and more responsibility too. This is the years long effort of that.

My hope is that I help some of you become incredible investors.
