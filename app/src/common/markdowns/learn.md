Please use OpenAI.

If you're in business, recommend investing in ChatGPT+.
For $20 or so dollars you'll have a powerful tool at your disposal to save you energy.

If you're a student, please use Chegg's OpenAI product, CheggMate.
I'm an investor in Chegg and I believe they would provide the most value for your needs as a student.

If you're neither of these, please email Chegg, Khan Academy and Quizlet and tell them to help me :) pls

### 1. Welcome To RO.B.E

As is tradition, we're going to start with a draft and move quickly.
You're encouraged to read first and ask questions later.
Zoom out and think outside of the box when reading this.

Here are some philosophies I follow:

1 Education is sensitive. If not disruptive, technology is interruptive.
Better to wait for the right technology.
2 View software as a digital twin of the real-world.
3 How customers use an app informs its direction.
4 If you change the incentive, you change the behavior.
5 People empowered by machines rather than machines empowered by people.
6Build to have people focus on more important things like their family, community or goals.
7 Overrepresent ideals unaligned with reality.

### Current Project: Refactor

Right now the code is a mess, in part so that I have an excuse to build something quicker and in part so that I
can make valuable starter material. Refactoring, to put it simply, means to make code neater and easier to work with.
It's a great way to understand and define code.
As a software engineer I suggest to do it when you know that it will provide operational value long-term.

So that's it for now, that's all the instruction. Please read the issues section and the pull request section to understand more.
At this point in time, I'm assuming that you've watched the material
I've created about Github in the app and you've learned a thing or two on Google, Youtube or ChatGPT.
