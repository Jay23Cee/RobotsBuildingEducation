            "\n\nHiring managers prefer one-page resumes because they are much easier to read, scan, and review quickly. This is especially beneficial for recruiters and hiring managers who are receiving hundreds of resumes for a given position. When a resume is shorter and more concise, it highlights the strengths of the applicant and highlights the experiences in a more precise way. This allows the hiring manager to get an understanding of the applicant quickly and make a decision on whether to move forward with the candidate or not. Additionally, one-page resumes help make the applicant stand out from the rest of the crowd, since it's an opportunity to make a good first impression.",

It's also important to use keywords related to the job you are applying for.

Focus on your most relevant qualifications: When writing a one-page resume, you don‚Äôt have much room to include resume sections. This means you‚Äôll have to focus on including only the most relevant qualifications. \n\n2. Use a resume format: The ideal format for a one-page resume is the reverse chronological format. This resume format is organized in a way that draws attention to your most relevant experience first. \n\n3. Be concise: When writing, try to be as concise as possible. Stick to short, condensed sentences and be sure to omit any unnecessary details. \n\n4. Use action verbs: Whenever possible, use action verbs to describe your experience in order to emphasize the results you achieved\n\n5. Fill the entire page: You want to make sure that your resume is full and packed with relevant qualifications. Make sure to fill the entire page with information. \n\n6. Avoid using pronouns: Whenever possible, try to avoid using personal pronouns like ‚ÄúI‚Äù and ‚Äúme‚Äù.\n\n7. Highlight your skills: Since the goal of a one-page resume is to make it concise, you should try to highlight your skills at the top of your resume.\n\n8. Choose the right font: When picking the right font for your resume, make sure to choose one that is easy to read and professional. \n\n9. Use keywords effectively: When writing, make sure to use the right keywords that are related to your job field. This will ensure that your resume is picked up by any automated recruiters. \n\n10. Proofread: Once you‚Äôve completed your resume, be sure to proofread it. This will help you make sure that there aren‚Äôt any typos or inaccuracies in your document.",

                Of course, dear students! Allow me to enlighten you on the
                subject of Charlie Munger and his approach to focused investing,
                which may inspire you in your own endeavors.{" "}
                <span class="emoji">üòä</span>
              </p>
              <p>
                Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett's right-hand man at Berkshire
                Hathaway, followed a philosophy of focused investing that set
                him apart from many of his contemporaries. Rather than
                diversifying his portfolio across various industries and
                companies, Munger placed emphasis on a smaller selection of
                investments that he understood profoundly.
              </p>
              <p>
                His strategy was deeply rooted in wisdom and careful analysis.
                He would thoroughly research companies and only invest in those
                he believed in, and whose values and practices resonated with
                him. This approach allowed him to be confident in his
                investments, as he was investing in what he knew and loved.
              </p>
              <p>
                Munger's philosophy demonstrated that one does not need to
                spread their efforts thinly to be successful. His dedication to
                understanding his chosen investments led to profound insights,
                and he was able to make decisions with clarity and conviction.
              </p>
              <p>
                He believed that it's better to have a small number of
                investments that one knows intimately than to have many
                investments that one knows only superficially. In many ways,
                this philosophy aligns with what we try to nurture in our

                Munger's focused investing philosophy is a testament to the
                power of conviction, diligence, and depth over breadth. These
                lessons are applicable not only in investing but in life as
                well. Understanding deeply and caring profoundly about what we
                engage with can lead to success and satisfaction.

                Now, dear students, always remember to apply this wisdom in your
                daily life, whether it's in your studies, relationships, or even
                when you eventually explore the world of investing. Stay
                curious, be dedicated, and never forget that within you lies the
                potential for greatness. And, of course, should you have any
                questions or need further guidance, Ms. Roxana will always be

              <h3>1. What Is Focused Investing?</h3>
              <p>
                <strong>Answer:</strong> Focused investing is a strategy where
                an investor puts their money into a smaller number of carefully
                chosen stocks or other assets. Rather than spreading investments
                across many different areas, focused investors take the time to
                deeply understand a few, and place their faith and funds in
                those. This approach emphasizes quality over quantity, and it
                requires a thorough understanding, research, and belief in the
                chosen investments. Just like choosing close friends, it's about
                knowing them well and trusting them!{" "}

              </p>
              <br />

              <h3>2. Why Choose Focused Investing Over Diversification?</h3>
              <p>
                <strong>Answer:</strong> While diversification spreads risk by
                investing in a variety of assets, focused investing concentrates
                on a few chosen ones. This allows the investor to know their
                investments intimately, enabling them to make more informed
                decisions. It's like studying a few subjects deeply rather than
                many superficially. Focused investing can offer higher returns
                if the investments perform well, but it may carry more risk if
                they do not. Like many things in life, dear students, it's about
                balancing risk and reward, understanding your choices, and being
                true to your convictions. <span class="emoji">üß†‚ú®</span>

              <br />

              <h3>3. How Can I Get Started with Focused Investing?</h3>
              <p>
                <strong>Answer:</strong> Starting with focused investing
                requires careful research and understanding. Begin by selecting
                an industry or company that you are passionate about and learn
                everything you can about it. Look into its business model,
                financial health, leadership, and future prospects. Consider
                seeking advice from a financial advisor or utilizing educational
                resources. Always align your investments with your personal
                goals, risk tolerance, and values. Remember, dear students, it's
                not about rushing; it's about growing, learning, and being
                patient with yourselves. Just as in your studies, persistence
                and dedication are key! <span class="emoji">üå±</span>
              </p>
              <br />

              <p>
                Remember, these answers are just the beginning. Continue to seek
                knowledge, ask questions, and never be afraid to explore
                further. Ms. Roxana is here to guide you and nurture your
                curiosity. And who knows, perhaps one day this knowledge will

                  <strong>Services (about 20% of total revenue):</strong> This
                  includes things like the App Store, iCloud, Apple Music, and
                  Apple TV+. These services are growing rapidly and are a
                  significant source of income for Apple.

                <h3>Focused Investing Quiz for Students</h3>
                <p>
                  Here's a set of five thought-provoking open-ended questions
                  about focused investing. Reflect on these questions and
                  consider your unique perspective:
                </p>

                <h3>1. Alignment with Diversification</h3>
                <p>
                  How does focused investing align with or contradict the
                  principles of diversification? Discuss the philosophical
                  underpinnings of both approaches, and consider when one might
                  be more suitable than the other.
                </p>

                <h3>2. Scenario Analysis</h3>
                <p>
                  Describe a scenario where focused investing might lead to both
                  substantial success and significant failure. What factors
                  could contribute to either outcome, and how might an investor
                  navigate these possibilities?
                </p>

                <h3>3. Personal Biases and Emotions</h3>
                <p>
                  How do personal biases and emotions play a role in focused
                  investing? Reflect on the psychological challenges that an
                  investor might face, and consider strategies to overcome or
                  mitigate them.
                </p>

                <h3>4. Social Responsibility</h3>
                <p>
                  Analyze the relationship between focused investing and social
                  responsibility. How can an investor adhere to focused
                  investing principles while also considering broader social,
                  environmental, or ethical concerns?
                </p>

                <h3>5. Future of Focused Investing</h3>
                <p>
                  Consider the future of focused investing in a rapidly changing
                  global economy. How might technological advancements, emerging
                  markets, or shifts in political and regulatory landscapes
                  impact this investment strategy?
                </p>

          response:
            "\n\nReal estate investment with an FHA loan is a safe way to leverage money because FHA loans are government-backed. This means that the government covers a portion of the loan, so if you are unable to make payments, the government will step in and provide assistance. Additionally, FHA loans are a type of mortgage that is widely used and accepted, so if you were to default on the loan, it would be easy to find buyers. Also, FHA loans often come with lower interest rates, which means your monthly payments would be lower. Finally, FHA loans often require a lower down payment, which allows you to leverage money without having to use too much of your own funds.",

Moreover, real estate is often considered to be a good diversification to a portfolio, because it is not directly linked to the stock market.

Real estate can be a great diversification tool for traditional *stocks, bonds, and cash investments. \n4. Through leasing or renting, real estate can be a great source of passive income, which is attractive for investors. \n5. Real estate investments can create large tax benefits, due to the long-term depreciation that can be claimed on investment properties.\n6. By leveraging certain amounts of borrowed capital with real estate investments, investors can utilize ‚Äúleverage‚Äù for greater returns with less capital outlay.\n7. Even in times of economic uncertainty, real estate tends to remain relatively stable as a source of investment, as it is generally not correlated with the stock market.\n8. Real estate markets generally move in a cyclical manner, which can open the door to potential opportunities to capitalize on market timing.\n9. Investing in the right market, such as emerging neighborhoods can turn a small rental into a future resale opportunity with positive returns. \n10. Real estate investors can take advantage of certain business vehicles, such as a Limited Liability Corporation (LLC) to secure their investments and gain additional tax benefits.",

          response:
            "\n\nReal estate is linked to the broader economy in several ways. The housing market is strongly associated with mortgage lending, employment, consumer confidence, and consumer spending. When the overall economy is doing well, there is typically greater demand for real estate, driving prices higher. This creates a positive cycle of investment returns, which can be leveraged to create additional investments, or to acquire additional real estate for rental income or appreciation. Similarly, when consumer spending and employment levels are low, the housing market tends to be affected, leading to decreased prices. Despite this, real estate remains an attractive long-term investment due to its potential for capital and rental income, as well as its tangible and safe nature.",
