Her company creates innovative robots and have won awards for their designs. What makes her story so inspiring is that she chose to focus on improving technologies in her home country, understanding the need for better robotics in India. She created a space for herself in a male-dominated field at a young age, inspiring the lives of many young girls in the process. Surya is an inspiring example of someone with a clear purpose who chose a problem she wanted to solve, and took a journey to use her skills, creativity and ambition to make real changes.`,

Research a variety of sources (books, magazines, websites, etc.), so that you can gain perspective and background information.\n\n5. Define objectives and goals for each problem. Ask questions such as, ‚ÄúWhat do I want to accomplish with this project? How can I measure success?‚Äù\n\n6. Identify a team to work on the problem and its solution. Make sure the team has the skills, expertise, and access that is needed for the project.\n\n7. Develop a plan of action that covers the timeline, budget, progress, guidelines and resources.\n\n8. Implement the solution. Take the necessary steps and put the plan into action.\n\n9. Monitor progress.
