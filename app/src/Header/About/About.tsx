            I have not collected testimonials. I'm sure the right ones will come
            in due time. Here are some relationships I'm proud to have created
            organically through media. Khan Academy was what inspired me many
            years ago, so I'm happy to be a rival AI company to "Khanmigo" today ðŸ˜ŠðŸ”ª

            Version 3 of the 16 lesson crash course is under development.
            Other than the crash course, you're granted a place to gain experience with me and a place 
            to explore further with computer science so that you consider a pathway to college.

            Creating content is like creating code, except you're more concerned with people than machines.
            Creator is a collection of content I'm writing centered around the power of communication and well-rounded &amp; cultural knowledge. My background
            in computer science specializes in human-computer interaction, which you may recognize as UI/UX.

            Before investing in things, I recommend understanding what it means to be a good business. Focus investing is the style of investing I recommend, which translates
            to being well-read, well-informed and modestly hungry for more knowledge. You'll know a good deal when you really understand the value of a dollar, and by that I mean you'll know a great deal of information about the world that operates around you.
